{"query":"coronavirus response to weather changes","definition":"The response of the coronavirus to weather changes refers to the potential influence of climatic conditions such as temperature, humidity, and UV radiation on the spread and prevalence of COVID-19. Studies suggest that countries closer to the equator, where heat and humidity are higher, tend to have fewer cases per million inhabitants. Additionally, a decrease in anthropogenic aerosol emissions due to lockdown measures may influence regional weather and climate conditions. However, these relationships are complex and can be influenced by various factors including human behavior and public health measures."}
{"query":"SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analysis","definition":"SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analysis refers to the study of the evolutionary relationships and origins of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, which causes COVID-19, using genome-based methods to construct phylogenetic trees or supertrees. This analysis can reveal information about the virus's genetic changes, emerging variants, transmission patterns, and its relationship with other coronaviruses. It can also help inform public health strategies and responses to the pandemic."}
{"query":"what alcohol sanitizer kills coronavirus","definition":"Alcohol-based hand sanitizers, containing at least 60% alcohol (usually isopropyl alcohol, ethanol or n-propanol), are effective in killing many types of germs including most viruses such as coronaviruses, and are recommended as a practical alternative when soap and water aren't available."}

## RAJ(entity)
{"query":"coronavirus response to weather changes","named_entity":["coronavirus"],"definition":"Coronavirus refers to a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds, including humans, where they can cause respiratory tract infections ranging from mild to lethal, with severe forms known as SARS, MERS and COVID-19."}
{"query":"SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic analysis","named_entity":["SARS-CoV-2","phylogenetic analysis"],"definition":"SARS-CoV-2, also known as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2, is a strain of coronavirus that causes COVID-19, a respiratory illness that can range from mild to severe and is responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic; it is highly contagious and primarily spreads through close contact and respiratory droplets, with potential for mutation leading to various variants. Phylogenetic analysis is a biological study that uses genetic data such as DNA or protein sequences to construct a diagram known as a phylogenetic tree, which represents the evolutionary history and relationships among different species or organisms, and is used in various fields including medical research, conservation biology, epidemiology, drug discovery and design."}
{"query":"what alcohol sanitizer kills coronavirus","named_entity":["alcohol sanitizer","coronavirus"],"definition":"Alcohol sanitizer is a liquid, gel, or foam solution containing types of alcohol such as ethanol or isopropyl alcohol, designed to inactivate microorganisms and temporarily suppress their growth on the hands, and is particularly used in healthcare settings for its effectiveness in reducing the transmission of pathogens and healthcare-associated infections. Coronavirus refers to a group of related RNA viruses that cause diseases in mammals and birds, including humans, where they can cause respiratory tract infections ranging from mild to lethal, with severe forms known as SARS, MERS and COVID-19."}
