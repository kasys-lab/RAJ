{"query":"Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies","definition":"Alkylphenol endocrine disruptors are a class of industrial pollutants that accumulate in the human body and are associated with allergic diseases, potentially influencing the onset, progression, and severity of these conditions; they are found in high levels in foods like chicken and fish due to bioaccumulation up the food chain."}
{"query":"Should We Avoid Titanium Dioxide?","definition":"Titanium dioxide (TiO2) is a chemical used as a coloring additive in various food products, cosmetics, and medical products, primarily for its ability to enhance whiteness and brightness; however, there are concerns about its safety due to potential accumulation in the body leading to DNA damage and immune system toxicity, prompting some health organizations to advise against its consumption."}
{"query":"Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics","definition":"Boosting good bacteria in the colon without probiotics refers to the process of enhancing the number of beneficial, butyrate-producing bacteria in our gut through a plant-based diet, which can lead to anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer effects."}

{"query":"Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors and Allergies","named_entity":["Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors","Allergies"],"definition":"Alkylphenol Endocrine Disruptors are hazardous substances, metabolites of alkylphenol ethoxylates (APEO), that can interfere with the body's hormone system and have been linked to adverse effects on human health, including potential risks to the nervous and immune systems, increased risk of allergies, and a significant association with endometrial cancer. Allergies are immune system reactions to foreign substances, known as allergens, such as pollen, bee venom, pet dander, certain foods and medicines, which cause symptoms ranging from minor irritation to severe reactions like anaphylaxis, and can be managed through avoidance of triggers, medication and in some cases immunotherapy."}
{"query":"Should We Avoid Titanium Dioxide?","named_entity":["Titanium Dioxide"],"definition":"Titanium Dioxide, also known as titanium(IV) oxide or titania, is a white, odorless inorganic compound derived from titanium with the chemical formula TiO2, used extensively as a pigment in products like paint, sunscreen, food coloring, and cosmetics due to its light-scattering properties and ability to enhance whiteness and opacity."}
{"query":"Boosting Good Bacteria in the Colon Without Probiotics","named_entity":["Colon","Probiotics"],"definition":"The colon, also known as the large intestine, is a U-shaped, segmented tube that connects to the rectum and works alongside the stomach and small intestine to remove stool and maintain fluid and electrolyte balance, with its primary function being to receive digested food from the small intestine and further digest it into a firm stool that passes from the body. Probiotics are live bacteria and yeasts, often referred to as \"good\" or \"helpful\" bacteria, that contribute to the health of the digestive system by balancing the body's microbiome, aiding in digestion, boosting immunity against infections, and potentially improving skin, urinary, vaginal and oral health."}
